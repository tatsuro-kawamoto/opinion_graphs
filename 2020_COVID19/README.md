## graphml
- They are bipartite opinion graphs, where 
	- physical nodes = opinion vertices
	- factor ndoes = respondent vertices
- They are unsigned graphs (positive edges only)
- Opinion texts are in Japanese

## Details
In each round, a set of screening questions was sent to approximately 10,000 individuals who are members of commercial web panels.
We then selected a sample of approximately 6,000 respondents each time, based on their demographic characteristics, to represent the Japanese general population in terms of their residency area, sex, and age groups. An invitation to our survey was sent to these selected individuals through a survey company. We used all the responses in our analysis and no further criteria has been applied to screen the respondents. The number of respondents who participated in the four rounds of the survey were 2103, 1516, 1729, and 1659, respectively.
